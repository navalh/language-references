# My Life's Work
This repo contains a myriad of different projects that I have worked on over the course of my schooling and working years. The majority relate to data analysis, with some software development and OOP sprinkled in. You can think of them as sample code "references" for the different Programming languages I am familiar with. These include Java, MATLAB, Python, R, SQL, Stata.

Unfortunately, some of the datasets imported by these files are not for public use. Consequently, a handful of the code files contained herein will no longer work as intended. I have tried to include datasets in the same folder as the relevant code whenever possible. In this case, the code file may require a tweak to the import file path in order to run on your local computer. If you are trying to run something on this repo and run into a snag, don't hesitate to reach out to me at nhanda94@gmail.com, and we can figure it out together. 

I mostly plan to use this repo for my own reference when I want to re-learn "dplyr" when I am 65 years old! Oh, and of course, to showcase my coding and commenting style to prospective employers, business partners, friends and students.
