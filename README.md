# My Life's Work
This repo contains different projects that I have worked on over the course of my schooling and working years. You can think of them as sample code "references" for the different Programming languages I am familiar with. These include Java, MATLAB, Python, R, SQL, Stata. Unfortunately, some of the datasets that these files manipulate are not for public use, and hence some of these files will no longer run as intended. I mostly plan to use this repo for my own reference when I want to see how I used to use "dplyr" when I am 65 years old!
