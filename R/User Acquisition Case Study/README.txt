These programs were created by Naval Handa to analyse a hypothetical company EP.
EP has acquired customers from two channels: channel1 and channel2. 
They want to better understand the type of customers that have been acquired through these channels,
and most importantly, which (if either) channel should be the focus of greater investment.

The goal of this challenge was to understand, visualize, and communicate key insights about
these customers. In particular,
1. What are important differences and similarities of the customers in each channel?
2. Which channel is more valuable to EP? How can we think about the magnitude of the
difference (think: practical and statistical significance)?
3. Are there any flaws or caveats related to the data? What additional data would be useful
to deepen your analysis and understanding?
